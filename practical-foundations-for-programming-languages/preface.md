# Preface

* types are the central organizing principle of the theory of programming languages
* lang features are manifestations of type structure
* syntax is goverened by constructs that define types
* semantics is determined by the interactions of the constructs

## Features
* statics - the rules governing the use of the feature in a program
* dynamics - the rules defining how programs using this feature are to be executed
* saftey - the coherence of the statics and the dynamics of a language

## Foundation

* establish a foundation for the study of programming languages
* _precise_/_intuitive_ methods to provide a uniform framework for explaining programming languages
* methods _scale_ to a wide range or pgramming language concepts

## Reading the book

Skim part 1. then give part 2 a good read through and return back to part 1 for clarification.
